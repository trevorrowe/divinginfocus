--- EXAMPLES ---

To get the examples running, please follow these steps

1) Request API access for Vimeo: http://www.vimeo.com/api
2) Fill out the &quot;Application Callback URL&quot; with an URL where you (and your
   local machine) can reach the authenticate.php file provided with this
   example (i.e. http://localhost/php5-simplevimeo/authenticate.php)
3) Fill in $sApiKey and $sApiSecret parameters in the class.vimeo.php file


--- SHORT AUTHENTICATION TUTORIAL ---

To get a full vimeo user integration onto your site we need a FROB.

In short: You provide a link where the user of your site will be linked to the vimeo login page.
There he gets an explanation which permissions your sites gets if he logs in (or &quot;links&quot; his account to
your vimeo application (therefore with your site)).

Once the user authenticates successfully with the vimeo login page, vimeo will header redirect to
the &quot;Application Callback URL&quot; given by you with a frob ID valid for one getToken request.

Now that you have the frob, you can request a token for this user. Tokens should be stored on
by-user-basis. One token is valid as long as the user is logged in on vimeo or the link to your
applicaiton is removed.
 
Thats the main stuff about this authentication procedure. Now for the very first step:
We need a frob. But first we need to send the user to the vimeo login page to link it.
 
(See http://www.vimeo.com/api/web-auth-howto for permission details)
 
The index page will let you choose between permission authentications to test the examples.

You can also skip the authentication if you just want to test API methods not requiring any permissions.
 
--- CODING STYLE ---

I know it can be a bit bad, but this is how i name my stuff:

$aSomething = array
$iSomething = integer
$sSomething = string
$bSomething = boolean
$oSomething = object instance
$eSomething = Something enumerated like a class constant i.e. VimeoBase::PERMISSION_NONE
$aoSomething = Array of object instances
$rSomething = Resource handle (i.e. for files)
$mSomething = mixed (i.e. can be array or string)
