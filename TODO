* provide a method for rendering a template from within a template
* fix url generation from routes, its picking not-so-pretty urls at times
  (see admin/users/1 -> edit action link)
* routing bug, not trimming trailing slash from url before matching

improve controller rendering options
-------------------------------------

* render($what);
* render_text($what)

* render_to_string();
* render_to_string('edit');
* render_to_string('forms/details')
* render_to_string('/login/form')

* render_text($str);



In production mode:
===================

  * check for the presence of a combined file stored in tmp
    of all the standard loadable files, such as routes, environment, etc,
    these files would get combined into a single php file and cached

    good or bad idea?
