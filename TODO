* allow setting output format from the action (esp with render_error_page)
* 

* implement before and after filters for controllers
* implement some emailng system
* implement logging levels (info, warn, etc)
* add environment configurations
* 

Big ideas
===================
* Support multiple view renders
* The framework should provide a method to cache the following for production:
  - what error pages exist (403, 404, 500, etc)
  - existing controllers
  - controller actions
  - helpers
  - environment config
  - etc
* Provide paperclip style file attachments in activerecord
* Profile session handling
  - tamerproof httponly encrypted cookie session store
  - standard php sessions
  - ...?
